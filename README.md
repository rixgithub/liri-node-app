# (LIRI Bot)

### Overview

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

To retrieve the data that will power this app, requests are sent to the Twitter, Spotify and IMDB APIs. These three Node packages were used for this application.

   * [Twitter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twitter)
   * [Spotify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify)
   * [Request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request)
     * You'll use Request to grab data from the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com).

liri.js can take in one of the following commands:

   * `my-tweets`

   * `spotify-this-song`

   * `movie-this`

   * `do-what-it-says`

### What Each Command Do

1. `node liri.js my-tweets`

   * This will show your last 20 tweets and when they were created at in your terminal/bash window.

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

   * This will show the following information about the song in your terminal/bash window
     * Artist(s)
     * The song's name
     * A preview link of the song from Spotify
     * The album that the song is from

   * if no song is provided then your program will default to
     * "The Sign" by Ace of Base

3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'
     * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>
     * It's on Netflix!

4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`
   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.
     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.
     * Feel free to change the text in that document to test out the feature for other commands.
